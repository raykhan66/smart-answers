Marriage in Sweden

Contact the [Swedish Tax Authorities](http://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish/contactus.4.4c5def2714bbf25766d2d6f.html) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Sweden](/foreign-travel-advice/sweden) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%
